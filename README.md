# Skin Disease Image Generation
 
Detailed Implementation:

1. Setting Up the Environment:
Ensure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed:
!pip install torch torchvision transformers diffusers clip

2. Fine-Tuning the CLIP Model:
Fine-tune CLIP to better understand and encode the specific textual descriptions related to skin rashes.

3. Training the Latent Diffusion Model:
Use the latent diffusion model to generate images based on the text embeddings produced by finetuned CLIP Model.
